First, only geotagged tweets were used. This led to a reduction of 98% of the initial dataset and therefore the dataset used for the spatial analysis is not representative for the whole dataset or Dutch social media users. However, given the size of the preprocessed dataset (1051 conversation pairs), deriving a conclusion is still possible. In addition, the methodology of this project provides proof of concept.\n","\n","Tweets that were part of an conversation_id that only occurred once were filtered out. This was done to avoid one-way conversations, and thus only take into account bidirectional tweets. However, it could be possible that tweets without the \"ik\" keyword were present in the conversation, but not in our dataset. This limitation is a result of our data harvesting method as some interactions are lost.\n","\n","Our method to establish a receiver’s location comes with some limitations. Our approach was to look for the presence of the in_reply_to_user_id from the resulting dataframe and match them to the user_id in the older dataframe with all geotagged tweets. Since people can also tweet from locations other than their home (vacation location, job office, etc.), we are aware that this location may not necessarily be their residency. Of course, this is true for all location data. However, for receiver’s locations there is an extra limitation due to the assumption that the first corresponding match is the receiver’s location for all occurrences of this in_reply_to_user_id."],"metadata":{"id":"jsI90o2fbudm"}}],"metadata":{"colab":{"provenance":[],"toc_visible":true},"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"name":"python"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":0}
